"The <<locality>> consists of a reference <<feature>> to start from and a "

"a stream out of a lake. In cases such as these, the "
"<<georeferencing-method>> is relatively simple (see <<Offset along a Narrow "
"Path>>). If the path is wide enough that multiple possible routes could be "
"taken along it, such as in a wide river, the method for dealing with it is a "
"little more complex (see <<Offset along a Wide Path>>). Sometimes there "
"might be multiple distinct possible paths that match the locality "
"description, such as two different roads in the same general matching "
"direction out of a town, and there is a third method to use to find the "
"<<georeference>> (see <<Offset along Multiple Possible Paths>>). In all "
"cases, the georeference will cover a segment of the path or possible paths "
"that includes all the sources of <<uncertainty>>. Though there might be a "
